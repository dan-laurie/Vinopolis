We worked with Baptiste Grangeon, owner and winemaker of renowned Domaine Cristia, to blend the perfect Châteauneuf – without the typical price tag. It’s blended from three different terroirs within the region: sand, limestone and the famous ‘galets roulés’ pebbles. The magic? Blending from these different terroirs is the secret to the best Châteauneuf. Dense. Rich. Heady. It’s full of spice and raspberry and redcurrant fruit. And its firm structure makes it perfect with Mediterranean-style foods, like rustic vegetable dishes.",

The region’s history with Pinot is younger, but if there was anyone who could help us get the blend just right it was Marlborough and Pinot experts, Saint Clair. With them we selected grapes from top parcels in the Southern Valleys – the best site for Pinot in the region. The results speak for themselves. It’s deliciously savoury with classic Marlborough dark fruit. Think black cherry and raspberry. It’s perfumed but fresh, with fine tannins and a lovely silky texture. Ideal with duck.",
